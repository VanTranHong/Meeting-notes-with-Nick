AISEC deadline on June 24

What have we done?

Datasets: we have 2 sets of data CIC and IoT data
Classifier: KDE (unsupervised)
Data to share (clean)


Our first approach: Data the extracted features.
Problem:
- Data sharing sometimes help and some times does not help
Our resolution:
We try to answer the question of how to discover if some information is useful, some information is not useful?
How to determine how much data should be shared? How much to combined between the shared data and our own data?
We try to use mutual information and Wasserstein difference to see relationship between the data

Our thinking:
The signature based method and anomaly method of anomaaly detection should be complementary to achieve best performance.
Normal data is fixed, does not change, does not reflect the anomaly that one person sees. Thus, not useful?
